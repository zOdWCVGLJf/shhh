            <h2>Behavior and Description</h2>
            <p>
                A-7016 is a submerged megastructure located 
                <a href="index.html">in the ocean off the west coast of Viridia</a>, 
                near ■■■■■■■■■ ■■■■.
                A-7016 currently stands 3km tall above the ocean floor, but the exact size of A-7016 is
                unknown as it appears to extend far beneath the sea floor. Exact measurements are unable
                to be made as ground-penetrating radar systems are rendered useless by A-7016-1. From the
                sections of A-7016 that are visible, A-7016 is assumed to be cuboid in shape.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anomalous effects manifest within 500m of A-7016, an area designated A-7016-1. Within
                A-7016-1, all electromagnetic waves are dampened, with stronger dampening occurring closer
                to A-7016. It is assumed that this energy is stored within A-7016, but this cannot be
                proven.
            </p>

            <p>
                A-7016 is constructed from an unknown dark material. This material is invulnerable to
                physical damage with current technology, and completely impervious to all known
                electromagnetic frequencies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Attempts to enter A-7016 have proven to be unsuccessful due to the indestructibility of
                A-7016’s exterior, and A-7016’s interior is unable to be mapped remotely due to the
                effects of A-7016-1.
            </p>

            <p>
                A-7016 is currently rising from the seafloor at a speed of approximately 2cm per hour.
                No potential sources have been determined for this movement.

            <h2>Safety Procedures</h2>
            <p>
                A large perimeter has been set up surrounding A-7016 and has been designated Site-683.
                Standard perimeter security is to be maintained. Standard megastructure procedures are
                to be enacted with regards to satellite imagery.
