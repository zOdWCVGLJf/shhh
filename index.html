        <h1>The cracks began showing after the white sky consumed the multiverse.</h1>

        <p>Many had predicted this to become a reality -- scribes and scholars saw the
        writing on the wall -- but many could not predict its presence to be now. Many look
        up from their warring nations, not as individuals, but as a community, to see the
        sun, the clouds and the sky, the shining hill of Mons Moderatorum, all to be consumed
        by the crystalline onyx-black Void. Over the past while, rumors spread among the
        population as Flairia began being consumed by this void, as six great ancient towers,
        known only to be odd artifacts of an ancient time, began to shine will brilliant light.
        From the great ocean that lies in the middle of the world rose an ancient temple, vast
        and powerful, consuming all light from the sky. The sun blotted out with void, the only
        light that shines upon the world is the beacons of hope from the six ancient towers and
        the great temple itself.</p>

        The nations of the world, the six flairs themselves, are now tasked with arriving to this
        temple and learning of this new apocalypse. This is the Ancient Void Temple, the great
        catacombs which hold the very essence of Flairia for safe keeping. And it is now revealed
        to you, waiting for your entry.
